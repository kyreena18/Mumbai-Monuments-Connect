        <p>The Prince of Wales Museum, now known as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, is one of 
            Mumbai&#39;s most iconic cultural institutions. Built to commemorate the 1905 visit of Prince George 
            (later King George V), it preserves India&#39;s rich heritage, particularly that of Mumbai. Officially 
            opening in 1922 after delays caused by World War I, the museum has played a pivotal role in showcasing 
            India&#39;s history and art. Architect George Wittet designed the museum in the Indo-Saracenic style, blending 
            Indian, Mughal, and Gothic architectural elements. Its grand dome, inspired by the Gol Gumbaz of Bijapur, 
            and intricate stone carvings are key highlights. The design also reflects a fusion of Islamic, Hindu, and 
            British influences, set amidst lush gardens. The museum was renamed to honor Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, 
            the revered Maratha king, further connecting it to India&#39;s indigenous history. Housing over 50,000 artifacts, 
            the museum&#39;s collection spans ancient sculptures, decorative arts, miniature paintings, Indian textiles, and 
            European art, making it one of India&#39;s premier museums. Located in the historic Fort area of South Mumbai, 
            near the Gateway of India, it is a hub for art and culture enthusiasts. The museum is open daily from 10:15 AM to 
            6:00 PM, offering exhibitions, workshops, and guided tours. Entry fees differ for Indian citizens and foreign tourists, 
            with additional charges for photography. Discounts are available for students and senior citizens. The museum continues 
            to be a vital institution for education and preservation, drawing visitors locally and globally, offering a window into 
            India&#39;s historical, artistic, and architectural splendors.
