            visitors alike. The interior of the station is adorned with stunning stained-glass windows, showcasing vibrant colors 
            that add to its charm. The station also features various facilities to assist passengers, including waiting areas, food 
            stalls, and ticket counters, ensuring a seamless travel experience.

            hub in India. The station is especially enchanting at night when its façade is illuminated, drawing in photographers
